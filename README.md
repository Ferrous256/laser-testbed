Laser Testbed
=============

*Above: Canny edge detector output via the laser projector.*

This codebase contains various experiments that I have run on the laser projector. If I like something, it'll be broken out into its own project and possibly ported to a compiled langauge. 

Early on, this code served as a tool for me to study the behavior
of the galvos. For all intents and purposes, there's nothing further to be done here. This was all experimental and remains merely a self-learning tool that I utilized in the past. 

Occasionally when I want to write something quickly, I'll come back to this code. But I expect future work to be done with **[Light Engine](https://github.com/echelon/light-engine)** once I've finished.

Libraries, License, etc.
------------------------
My code is MIT-licensed, however some of the includes may not be.

**Batteries Included:**

* Jacob's GPL-licensed daclib code for the EtherDream DAC. 
* Several Graffiti Markup Language (GML) files from 
  http://000000book.com/

**Still Required:**

* PyGML for the GML/graffiti demos
* OpenCV for the image processing code
* A parent's permission

My other (better) laser stuff
-----------------------------
* [Laser Asteroids](https://github.com/echelon/laser-asteroids) is a game loosely based on the arcade classic "Asteroids" that I programmed for the Fall 2012 Georgia Game Jam. 
* [Light Engine](https://github.com/echelon/light-engine) work in progress lasing engine in C++. This project aims to become a fast 2D laser graphics engine for videogames, realtime drawing, and other interactive applications.
