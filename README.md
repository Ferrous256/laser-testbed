Laser Testbed
-------------
Various experiments I run on the projector. If I like something, it'll 
be broken out into its own project and possibly ported to a precompiled
langauge. 

Early on this served as a tool for me to study and model the behavior 
of the galvos. This is all still very experimental and remains 
primarily a self-learning tool.

My other (better) laser stuff
-----------------------------
* [Laser Asteroids](https://github.com/echelon/laser-asteroids) is a 
  game loosely based on the arcade classic "Asteroids" that I 
  programmed for the Fall 2012 Georgia Game Jam.
