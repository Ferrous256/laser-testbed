Laser Testbed
=============
Various experiments I run on the projector. If I like
something, it'll be broken out into its own project and
possibly ported to a precompiled langauge. 

Early on this served as a tool for me to study and model 
the behavior of the galvos. This is all still very
experimental and remains primarily a self-learning tool.
