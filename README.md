Laser Testbed
-------------

*Disclaimer:* 

This is where I'll keep the various experiments I run on the laser.
Very little of this qualifies as interesting or useful, it's just a 
means for me to study and model the behavior of the galvos. This is 
a learning tool. 

I should mention that this was built for the EtherDream DAC. 
Also, some of Jacob's code is in here, and it's GPL licensed. 

**Actual interesting stuff:**

* [Laser Asteroids](https://github.com/echelon/laser-asteroids) is a game 
  based on the classic "Asteroids" that I programmed for the EtherDream for
  the 2012 Fall Georgia Game Jam. I'll incrementally improve it and add 
  features as time allows.
